# EDL21-Control

This video demonstrates the use of the EDL21-Control-App. The App ueses the iPhones flashlight and the powermeters optical sensor to communicate. The App simplifies the unlocking of the powermeter with a 4-digit pincode and also allows the user to easily control the different functions of the powermeter. The manufacturer intendet the code to be entered with a flashlight, which confused many users.

### What kind of powermeter is this?
This is a new powermeter, which is compatible to a new standard, which every new powermeter, mounted in a german household from now on, has to conform to. This means, that the powermeter is not anymore just an analog device, but rather can display information like your energy usage over the last day/week/month and so on.

### Why not a simple button to control the powermeter? 
There are versions of this powermeter which are controlled with a button. But in many apartment buildings in germany, the powermeter is mounted behind a glas panel or some other kind of protective grid. That is, because some people try to manipulate their powermeter, so that it counts less energy, than acual used by the household. So the manufacturer added an optical sensor, so everybody is able to control the powermeter with a flashlight.

### Why does the powermeter need a 4-digit-code?
To prevent other people from watching energy-statistics, which are not their own. For example: Im am able to point a flashlight to my neighbours powermeter, but as long as I don't know his code, I am not able read how much energy he used.

### Why no more analog powermeters?
It was pretty easy to manipulate analog powermeters by slowing them down with a magnet, which was a problem for the energy utility companies. The new powermeters are also a step towards a connected future. One day, with even more advanced devices, the powermeters send the households energyusage to the energy utility companies, without a need for them to send an employee who reads the powerusage.
